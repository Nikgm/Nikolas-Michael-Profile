                      Hi, my name is Nikolas Michael. I specialize in web design, frontend and backend development, mobile application and software development.
                      My original expertise is in electrical manufacturing. I have a diploma and many certifications related to electrical and robotic systems.
                      I have recently switched my focus to programming and have acquired many skills and certifications including the completion of a code bootcamp.
                      You can see my most recent projects and the source code associated with them in the "Projects" section. If you wish to know more about me and
                      my skills, you can read more about them in the "Resume" section. My phone number and email are listed below, or you can send me an email directly
                      from this site. Be sure to leave a review at the bottom on how I could improve my site or any issues you ran into. Thank you!
                    </p>
